# atari_rl
Jupyter notebooks to use reinforcement learning to play atari games

The code will create a model and play a game using the model as input.  The frames, actions, and rewards are stored.  When the game is complete, the model is trained using the data captured.  At this point, Space Invaders will play in a somewhat competent manner, then stop improving.  It's a work in progress.
